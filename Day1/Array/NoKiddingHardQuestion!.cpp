The basic rules of 6x6 Sudoku puzzle are as follows:
    • The numbers of 1 to 6 must occur only once in each column.
    • The numbers of 1 to 6 must occur only once in each row.
    • The numbers of 1 to 6 must occur only once in each block of 2x3.

Write a program that uses a 6×6 arrays to represent a Sudoko puzzle. The program will read an input
file with the following format:
    5 3 1 2 6 4
    2 4 6 1 5 3
    1 6 3 5 4 2
    4 5 2 3 1 6
    3 1 4 6 2 5
    2 6 5 4 3 1
    
Then, the values will be mapped to the 6x6 matrix. The program must determine whether the puzzle is
either a feasible puzzle or infeasible puzzle. For infeasible puzzle, the program must identify and
explain/describe all the rule violations.
