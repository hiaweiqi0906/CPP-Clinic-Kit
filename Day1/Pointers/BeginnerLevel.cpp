	// 10. Create new variable, type=double, name=myBankBalance, value=?
	//		Then, create pointer variable points to that variable

	// 11. Print address in the pointer, and value pointed by that address. 
	
	// 12. Your bank balance has increased 100. Update it using pointer notation. 
	
	// 13. You are lazy to use array notation for some reason...Hahaha
	//		Create pointer points to cookiesEachBag(array). Hints: Remember the data type!
	
	// 14. By using pointer notation: Print how many cookies in every bag
	
	// 15. By using pointer notation: Add 1 cookie to every bag in cookiesEachBag
	
	// 16. By using pointer notation: Create another pointer, point to owner(array). Dont forget the data type!

	// 17. By using pointer notation: Let user input name one by one
	
	// 18. By using pointer notation: Print out how many cookies, with each person's name
	//  	eg: Ali: 2, Muthu: 5,...
	
	// Curious?? Can a pointer points to 2d array?
