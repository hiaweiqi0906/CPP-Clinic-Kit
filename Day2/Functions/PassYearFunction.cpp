 (c) Mr.  Sam  taught  a  programming  class  of  ten  students  in  the  first  semester. 
 Throughout the semester, students took four (4) assessments (i.e. 2 tests and 2  assignments).  
 The  test  weightage  is  10%  each  and  the  assignment  weightage is 15% each. Mr. Sam 
 would like to calculate the coursework marks for each of his students. Coursework mark is a 
 total of all four (4) assessments according to their weightage. 

    (i) Write a function Get_Scores that captures the scores entered by Mr. Sam for all ten 
    students. This function accepts an array as input. This function should be generic so that 
    it can be re-used to store marks into separate arrays according to the assessments later. 

    (ii) Write a function Calculate_Coursework that calculates the coursework mark of each student 
    and  stores  them  in  an  array  name  CWMarks  and  displays  the  content  of  CWMarks  to  
    the  screen.  This  function accepts five (5) arrays for each of the followings StudentID, Test1, 
    Test2, Assignment1 and Assignment2.
